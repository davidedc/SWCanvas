/**
 * LEGACY: Basic polygon clipping implementation (NOT CURRENTLY USED)
 * 
 * This file contains the old path-based polygon clipping system that was
 * replaced by the stencil-based clipping system in context2d.js. The stencil
 * system provides better performance, memory efficiency, and HTML5 Canvas
 * compatibility. This code is kept for reference purposes.

 * Current clipping system: See context2d.js - stencil-based 1-bit clipping
