# Documentation Index

## Documentation Strategy

Each document has a specific responsibility to avoid duplication and maintain clarity:

- **README.md**: Quick start, API examples, build instructions, testing overview
- **ARCHITECTURE.md**: System design, component organization, architectural patterns  
- **tests/README.md**: Test system documentation, adding tests, build utilities
- **CLAUDE.md**: Claude development context, project-specific guidance
- **specs-and-high-level-project-plan.md**: Requirements specification, implementation details

## Quick Navigation

- **Getting started** → README.md
- **Understanding the design** → ARCHITECTURE.md  
- **Adding tests** → tests/README.md
- **Development with Claude** → CLAUDE.md
- **Technical specifications** → specs-and-high-level-project-plan.md

## Cross-References

All documents use cross-references to avoid duplication:
- API examples are centralized in README.md
- Architecture details are centralized in ARCHITECTURE.md
- Test documentation is centralized in tests/README.md
