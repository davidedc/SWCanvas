/**
 * TEST SUMMARY:
 * =================
 *
 * Description: Renders 20 lines with 10px black opaque strokes at random positions and orientations. This test is used for both visual regression and performance measurement.
 *
 *
 * ---
 *
 * | Facet                  | Value          | Reason
 * |------------------------|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * | Shape category         | lines          | The test draws lines using `ctx.strokeLine`.
 * | Count                  | multi-20       | The test is configured to draw 20 lines in its standard visual regression mode.
 * | SizeCategory           | mixed          | Line length is determined by two random points, resulting in a variable length that spans multiple size categories.
 * | FillStyle              | none           | `ctx.fillStyle` is set to `rgba(0,0,0,0)`, meaning no fill is applied.
 * | StrokeStyle            | opaque         | `ctx.strokeStyle` is set to `rgb(0,0,0)`, which is fully opaque.
 * | StrokeThickness        | 10px           | `ctx.lineWidth` is explicitly set to the constant value `10`.
 * | Layout                 | spread         | 20 lines are drawn, each with independently randomized start/end points, distributing them across the canvas.
 * | CenteredAt             | N/A            | This facet is not applicable for lines, which are defined by endpoints, not a geometric center.
 * | EdgeAlignment          | not-crisp      | The random start and end points result in angled lines that are inherently not pixel-aligned.
 * | Orientation            | random         | The orientation of each line is determined by its two random endpoints, resulting in random angles.
 * | ArcAngleExtent         | N/A            | Not an arc shape.
 * | RoundRectRadius        | N/A            | Not a rounded rectangle shape.
 * | ContextTranslation     | none           | The drawing context is not translated; no `ctx.translate()` is called.
 * | ContextRotation        | none           | The drawing context is not rotated; no `ctx.rotate()` is called.
 * | ContextScaling         | none           | The drawing context is not scaled; no `ctx.scale()` is called.
 * | Clipped on shape       | none           | No clipping region is defined or applied in this test.
 * | Clipped on shape count | n/a            | Not applicable as no clipping is used.
 * | Clipped on shape arrangement | n/a      | Not applicable as no clipping is used.
 * | Clipped on shape size  | n/a            | Not applicable as no clipping is used.
 * | Clipped on shape edge alignment | n/a   | Not applicable as there is no clipping.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * UNCAPTURED ASPECTS IN FILENAME / FACETS ABOVE:
 * ----------------------------------------------
 * The line length is randomized between 1 and ~301 pixels, which spans the XS, S, M, L, and XL size categories.
 * The position and orientation are fully randomized within the canvas bounds. The stroke color is fixed black.
