- **âœ… Integration Testing**: All transform+clip+stroke combinations tested
- **âœ… Production Ready**: 55 comprehensive tests all passing

#### Detailed Implementation Plan

**Phase A: Data Structures (1-2 days)** âœ… COMPLETED
- [x] Add `clipMask` field to Context2D state (Uint8Array with 1 bit per pixel)
- [x] Implement bit manipulation helpers: `setBit()`, `getBit()`, `clearMask()`
- [x] Add clipMask to save/restore state stack for proper nesting
- [x] Memory management: allocate/deallocate clipMask only when needed

**Phase B: Clip Pixel Writer (1 day)** âœ… COMPLETED  
- [x] Implement `clipPixel(x, y, coverage)` function that writes to temporary clip buffer
- [x] Modify existing `setPixel()` to multiply coverage by current clipMask bit
- [x] Handle edge cases: out-of-bounds, invalid coordinates
- [x] Optimize for common case where no clipping is active

**Phase C: Clip Method Implementation (1-2 days)** âœ… COMPLETED
- [x] Add `clip(path, fillRule = 'nonzero')` method to Context2D
- [x] Redirect pixel writer to clipPixel during clip fill operation
- [x] Create temporary clip buffer during fill, then combine with existing clipMask using AND
- [x] Handle first clip (no existing mask) vs subsequent clips (intersection)
- [x] Ensure fillRule ('evenodd' vs 'nonzero') is properly respected

**Phase D: Integration with Rendering Pipeline (1 day)** âœ… COMPLETED
- [x] Modify final pixel output to multiply by clipMask bit
- [x] Ensure shadows are clipped (apply clipMask to shadow rendering)
- [x] Update stroke rendering to respect clipping
- [x] Handle anti-aliasing edge cases where coverage needs precise bit handling

**Phase E: Memory Optimization (1 day)** âœ… COMPLETED
- [x] Lazy allocation: only create clipMask when first clip() is called
- [x] Efficient bit packing: 8 pixels per byte with bit operations
- [x] Memory cleanup: deallocate clipMask when no clips are active
- [x] Consider clipMask sharing/copying for save/restore efficiency

**Phase F: Testing & Validation (2-3 days)** âœ… COMPLETED
- [x] Create comprehensive clipping intersection tests
- [x] Test save/restore behavior with nested clips
- [x] Validate performance with large canvases
- [x] Test edge cases: empty clips, out-of-bounds clips, transform interactions
- [x] Update existing clip-intersection test to use real intersections again

#### Technical Details

**1-Bit Stencil Buffer Format:**
```
Memory layout: width Ã— height bits packed into Uint8Array
Bit access: byte = clipMask[Math.floor(pixelIndex/8)]; bit = byte & (1 << (pixelIndex%8))
Memory usage: width Ã— height Ã· 8 bytes (vs width Ã— height bytes for full coverage)
```

**Clip Intersection Logic:**
```
Initial state: no clipMask (all pixels available)
First clip(): create clipMask, fill with 1s where path covers
Second clip(): temp mask from new path, AND with existing: clipMask[i] &= tempMask[i]
Result: only pixels covered by ALL clips have bit = 1
```

**Performance Considerations:**
- Bit operations are fast but need care for cache alignment
- Large canvases (4K) need ~2MB for clip mask vs 16MB for full coverage
- Most common case (no clipping) should have near-zero overhead
- Consider SIMD operations for bulk bit manipulation if performance critical

#### Success Criteria âœ… ALL ACHIEVED
- [x] Clipping intersection tests pass with pixel-perfect HTML5 Canvas matching
- [x] Save/restore properly manages clip stack nesting
- [x] Performance degradation < 10% for non-clipped rendering
- [x] Memory usage reasonable for large canvases (1-bit per pixel achieved)
- [x] All existing tests continue to pass

#### Risk Mitigation
- **Memory pressure**: Use lazy allocation, deallocate aggressively
- **Performance regression**: Profile carefully, optimize hot paths
- **Complexity creep**: Keep implementation simple, avoid premature optimization
- **Edge case bugs**: Comprehensive test suite, especially transform interactions
